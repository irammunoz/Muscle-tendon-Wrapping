Simulations
A simple but representative muscle wrapping was simulated under two cases: (1) The muscle-tendon unit remains in contact with the cylindrical surface and (2) The muscle-tendon unit transitions from a wrapping state to a non-wrapping state.

The numerical efficiency is investigated considering the classical Newton-Raphson and two Quasi-Newton (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno and Broyden) methods
